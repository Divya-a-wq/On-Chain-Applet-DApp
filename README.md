WeilChain AppletHub
A Decentralized Applet Marketplace on WeilChain

Discover, execute, and compose on-chain applets with wallet-based authentication, transparent execution history, and a monetizable ecosystem for creators.

Overview

WeilChain AppletHub is a decentralized application marketplace built on WeilChain that enables users to discover, execute, and compose small reusable on-chain programs called applets. The platform provides secure wallet-based authentication, transparent on-chain execution history, and a fair monetization model for applet creators.

The goal of the project is to build an on-chain App Store that promotes decentralization, composability, and trustless execution.

Problem Statement

Centralized app marketplaces lack transparency
Execution logic is hidden and cannot be verified
Developers face unfair or unclear monetization models
Users must rely on centralized infrastructure

Solution

WeilChain AppletHub provides decentralized applet discovery
Wallet-based authentication and payments
On-chain execution and execution history tracking
Composable applets for building workflows
Direct and transparent monetization for creators
