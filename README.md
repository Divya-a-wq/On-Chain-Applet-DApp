# WeilChain AppletHub  
## A Decentralized Applet Marketplace on WeilChain

Discover, execute, and compose on-chain applets with wallet-based authentication, transparent execution history, and a monetizable ecosystem for creators.

---

## 📖 Overview

WeilChain AppletHub is a decentralized application (dApp) marketplace built on **WeilChain** that enables users to discover, execute, and compose small reusable on-chain programs called *applets*. The platform provides secure wallet-based authentication, transparent on-chain execution history, and a fair monetization model for applet creators.

The goal is to build an **on-chain App Store** that promotes decentralization, composability, and trustless execution.
